## Protocol: Initial pain assessment (adult)

**When:** any reported or suspected pain.

**Assessment questions (OPQRST / SOCRATES):**
- **O**nset: When did it start? Sudden or gradual?
- **P**rovocation/palliation: What makes it better/worse?
- **Q**uality: Sharp, dull, burning, cramping?
- **R**egion/radiation: Where is it? Does it move?
- **S**everity: 0–10 scale. Worst? Current?
- **T**iming: Constant or intermittent? Trend?

**Immediate checks:**
- Vital signs: HR, BP, RR, SpO2, temperature.
- Red flags: chest pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, hypotension, uncontrolled bleeding.

**Documentation:**
- Numeric rating scale (NRS) or appropriate scale.
- Functional impact (e.g., can speak, move, sleep).

## Protocol: Severe acute pain (NRS 8–10)

**Clinical principle:** severe pain warrants rapid reassessment and timely analgesia.

**Suggested actions:**
- Reassess immediately and confirm location/quality.
- Check vitals and sedation/respiratory status.
- Consider fast-acting analgesia per local protocol.
- Consider escalation if refractory, associated with instability, or new neuro deficits.

**Examples of escalation triggers:**
- Rapid pain escalation within minutes.
- Pain with hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia.
- Post-procedure pain out of proportion.

## Protocol: Moderate pain (NRS 4–7)

**Suggested actions:**
- Reassess and quantify pain + functional limitation.
- Use multimodal analgesia principles (non-opioid options when appropriate).
- Reassess response after intervention.

## Protocol: Mild pain (NRS 1–3)

**Suggested actions:**
- Non-pharmacologic measures may be sufficient.
- Patient education, positioning, ice/heat as appropriate.

## Protocol: Pediatric pain assessment (high level)

**Scale selection:**
- Non-verbal or young children: validated observational scale (e.g., FLACC).
- Verbal children: faces scale or NRS depending on age.

**Key point:** avoid directly mapping adult NRS interventions to pediatrics without pediatric-specific guidance.

## Protocol: Post-operative adult pain (general)

**Clinical principle:** aim for adequate analgesia enabling breathing, coughing, and early mobilization.

**Suggested actions:**
- Encourage mobility and pulmonary hygiene as tolerated.
- Prefer oral medications when feasible; reserve escalation pathways for uncontrolled pain.
- Watch for complications: increasing pain with fever, wound changes, hypotension, confusion.

## Protocol: Triage / urgency notes

**Rapid escalation considerations:**
- Pain with signs of shock or respiratory compromise.
- New focal neurological symptoms.
- Sudden severe headache or abdominal pain with guarding.

## Protocol: Interpreting vocal/acoustic signs (explainability bridge)

**Disclaimer:** Acoustic patterns are not diagnostic. Use as supportive cues only.

- **Irregular breathing / audible breathiness:** may correlate with distress, guarding, or sympathetic activation.
- **Increased pitch / pitch instability:** may correlate with stress and autonomic arousal.
- **Speech hesitation / reduced speech rate:** may correlate with discomfort, cognitive load, or dyspnea.
