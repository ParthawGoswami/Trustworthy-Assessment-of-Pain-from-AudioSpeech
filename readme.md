## Dataset Overview

The TAME Pain Dataset consists of 7,039 annotated utterances totaling 311.24 minutes of audio data. Each utterance is labeled with self-reported pain levels and categorized based on the presence or absence of pain, pain severity, and experimental conditions (cold/warm). Additionally, the dataset includes annotations regarding audio quality and disturbances to assist in data preprocessing and analysis.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into the following main components:

1. **Audio Recordings**
2. **Metadata Files**
3. **Annotations**

## Accessing the Data

The TAME Pain Dataset is available on the [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/) data platform. 

## File Descriptions

### Audio Recordings

- **File:** `mic1_trim_v1.zip`
- **Description:** Contains 51 subfolders, each representing a participant identified by a unique Participant ID (PID). Each subfolder includes audio recordings in `.wav` format, trimmed using Voice Activity Detection (VAD).
- **File Naming Convention:** `PID.COND.UTTNUM.UTTID.wav`
  - **PID:** Participant Identification (e.g., `p12345`)
  - **COND:** Experimental Condition (`LC`, `LW`, `RC`, `RW`)
  - **UTTNUM:** Utterance Number (sequential per condition)
  - **UTTID:** Utterance ID (corresponds to assigned sentence or `99999` for pain statements)

### Metadata Files

1. **Audio Metadata**
   - **File:** `meta_audio.csv`
   - **Description:** Contains metadata for each audio file.
   - **Columns:**
     - `PID`: Participant Identification
     - `COND`: Experimental Condition
     - `UTTNUM`: Utterance Number
     - `UTTID`: Utterance ID
     - `PAIN LEVEL`: Raw self-reported pain level
     - `REVISED PAIN`: Modified pain level aligned with the 1-10 scale
     - `DURATION`: Duration of the audio file in seconds
     - `ACTION LABEL`: Quality rating of the audio (0-4)
     - `NOTES`: Manual annotations and comments

2. **Participant Data**
   - **File:** `meta_participant.csv`
   - **Description:** Contains demographic and experimental data for each participant.
   - **Columns:**
     - `PID`: Participant Identification
     - `GENDER`: Self-reported gender
     - `AGE`: Age in years
     - `RACE/ETHNICITY`: Self-reported race/ethnicity
     - `FOLDER SIZE`: Storage size of audio files in megabytes
     - `NUMBER OF FILES`: Total number of audio files
     - `TOTAL DURATION`: Total duration of audio files in seconds
     - `LC`, `LW`, `RC`, `RW`: Completion status of each experimental condition (`1` for completed, `0` for incomplete)

### Annotations

- **Folder:** `Annotations`
- **Description:** Contains seven CSV files, each representing a distinct annotation category. Utterances can belong to multiple categories.

#### Annotation Files

1. **External Disturbances**
   - **File:** `External_Disturbances.csv`
   - **Description:** Records external noises unrelated to participant vocalization.
   - **Additional Column:** `NOISE RELATION` (Foreground, Background, or Both)

2. **Speech Errors and Disturbances**
   - **File:** `Speech_Errors_and_Disturbances.csv`
   - **Description:** Captures speech errors and verbal disturbances.

3. **Audio Cut Out**
   - **File:** `Audio_Cut_Out.csv`
   - **Description:** Notes instances where audio was cut, leading to loss of parts of sentences.

4. **Audible Breath**
   - **File:** `Audible_Breath.csv`
   - **Description:** Identifies audible inhales/exhales by participants.

5. **No Pain Rating So Copied**
   - **File:** `No_Pain_Rating_So_Copied.csv`
   - **Description:** Indicates audio files without a pain rating that were assigned a pain level based on adjacent ratings.

6. **No Assigned Sentence**
   - **File:** `No_Assigned_Sentence.csv`
   - **Description:** Marks audio files where the assigned sentence was not spoken.

7. **No Pain Rating**
   - **File:** `No_Pain_Rating.csv`
   - **Description:** Lists audio files without any pain rating and no adjacent ratings to copy from.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Access the dataset via the provided PhysioNet link.
   - Download the `mic1_trim_v1.zip` file and the associated metadata and annotation files.

2. **Extract Audio Recordings:**
   - Unzip `mic1_trim_v1.zip` to access participant folders containing `.wav` audio files.

3. **Understand File Naming:**
   - Use the file naming convention (`PID.COND.UTTNUM.UTTID.wav`) to navigate and identify specific audio files.

4. **Refer to Metadata:**
   - Utilize `meta_audio.csv` for detailed information about each audio file.
   - Use `meta_participant.csv` to access participant demographics and condition completion statuses.

5. **Handle Annotations:**
   - Explore the `Annotations` folder to understand and utilize the various annotation categories.
   - Multiple annotations for a single file are separated by semicolons in the `NOTES` column.

6. **Data Analysis:**
   - Leverage the `ACTION LABEL` for filtering audio quality.
   - Use pain level annotations for classification tasks (Binary, Three-Class, Condition).

## Additional Details

- **Pain Level Adjustments:**
  - Original pain levels of `0` were relabeled to `1` to maintain a 1-10 scale.
  - Pain levels are categorized into:
    - **Binary Task:** No Pain (1-3), Pain (4-10)
    - **Three-Class Task:** Mild (1-3), Moderate (4-6), Severe (7-10)
    - **Condition Task:** Warm (`LW`, `RW`), Cold (`LC`, `RC`)

- **Audio Quality Labels:**
  - `ACTION LABEL` ranges from `0` (highest quality) to `4` (lowest quality), based on the presence of disturbances and errors.

- **Background Noise:**
  - All recordings have a uniform background fan noise, with varying intensities across participants.

- **Exclusion of Unlabeled Utterances:**
  - Five utterances without pain ratings were excluded from the dataset.
